People who have tested are asked to wait 72 hours before calling the Negative Results line. Most people who have been tested are calling before the 72 hours and, as a result, the line is experiencing an extremely high call and voicemail volume. We ask for your patience and to wait at least 72 hours before calling for your result. If you have spoken with an operator or left a voicemail with your information, you have been placed in a queue and a nurse will follow-up when your result is ready. Please do not call back. \n\nIf someone tests positive, public health will contact them. However, while you wait for your test result, you should follow the advice of your doctor or testing provider to self-isolate.\n\nPlease note: Testing results are not available in-person at the BCCDC."
