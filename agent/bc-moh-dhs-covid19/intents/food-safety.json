COVID-19 is spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. There is a theoretical risk that a person infected with COVID-19 could spread the virus by sneezing on food or by directly touching food with their hands. However, there have been no cases reported of such transmission with COVID-19. To be safe, if you are sick with COVID-19, do not prepare or handle food for others.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor more details, refer to \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/prevention-risks/food-safety\" target\u003d_blank\u003e food safety\u003c/a\u003e.",
